# Occurity

## What it is
Occurity is a fully-featured patient visual acuity test software designed for use on the RaspBerry Pi hardware platform. It enables you to built an affordable visual acuity test system using a few pieces of hardware and basically any remote control. If you do not have the option to buy the infrared receiver, it can also be used with a keyboard.

## Included tests
- ETDRS, HOTV, numbers, Landolt C and Tumbling E charts
- Astigmatism dots and astigmatism rays charts
- Coincidence, Worth 4 dots and mirrored RED / GREEN charts

## What you need

### Hardware
In order to install a system running Occurity you need the following hardware:

**Required**
* A Raspberry Pi (3 or 4)
* At least a 2 GB SD flash card
* A monitor with at least 300 cd/m² brightness (preferably 350 cd/m²)

**Optional**
* A [Flirc infrared reciever](https://flirc.tv/more/flirc-usb)
  * A remote control that works with flirc. Most do.

#### Monitor

##### Resolution
Occurity displays correctly on any monitor using any resolution provided the following two requirements are met:
* The physical length of the ruler must be set correctly in the Occurity [Preferences](docs/PREFERENCES.md) dialog.
* The physical distance from the patients eyes to the monitor must be set correctly in the Occurity [Preferences](docs/PREFERENCES.md) dialog.

To test if the monitor you are using reports its resolution correctly to the Occurity software, please set the width of the ruler in the [Preferences dialog](docs/PREFERENCES.md), temporarily set the patient distance to 600 cm and measure the width of any of the Sloan optotype symbols on the screen at chart size 0.1 and 0.25. At 0.1 the width must be 87 mm and at 0.25 the width must be 35 mm. If this is correct your monitor will work with Occurity.

To test if your monitor scales the distance correctly, you should also check the sizes at 400 cm patient distance. Here the width of a Sloan optotype symbol must be 58 mm at 0.1 and 23 mm at 0.25.

##### Brightness calibration
DISCLAIMER!!! This is only a guideline: Using a lux meter pushed up against the monitor surface, you should have a readout of about 277 lux. Hence the need for a monitor that is capable of a high brightness level.

##### Tested working with the following monitors
* Asus VG248QE

#### Remote controls

##### Tested working with the following remote controls
* LG AKB75095344
* Samsung AA59-00818A

In theory most remote controls you might have lying around should work with the disclaimer that there are some remotes that use dual-output signals which makes them hard to use with the flirc interface. Only way to know is to just try.

Note! The [Flirc infrared reciever](https://flirc.tv/more/flirc-usb) emulates a keyboard. For the remote to work, you need to install the Flirc software on a supported OS and configure the buttons on your remote to correspond with [these](README.md#keyboard-controls) keyboard keys.

## How to install Occurity
You have two options for installing and running Occurity. Either use the pre-built SDCard images or built one yourself from scratch.

## Option 1: Using a pre-built SDCard image
If you require no customization of the image this is the easiest way to get up and running. Simply download the SDCard image corresponding to your Raspberry Pi from the [latest release files](https://github.com/muldjord/occurity/releases/latest). Decompress the image and flash it to an SDCard. Insert the SDCard in your Raspberry Pi and you are done! Be sure to check the rest of the documentation on how to use Occurity.

## Option 2: Building a custom Occurity SDCard image
The step-by-step procedure for building an Occurity image that can be flashed to an SDCard for the Raspberry Pi hardware platform is described in detail below. The build is currently based on the `scarthgap` release of the very popular [Yocto embedded platform](https://www.yoctoproject.org).

The only pre-requisite is a working Ubuntu 22.04 installation with at least 150 GB available harddrive space. The final SDCard image will be about 1 GB. You might also be able to make this work on any previous or later Ubuntu LTS release. The main difference will probably be the package pre-requisites. Refer to the [official Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/index.html) for further information.

### Package pre-requisites
Install the required packages by running the following two commands:
```
$ sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 python3-subunit zstd liblz4-tool file locales libacl1
$ sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
```

### Setting up Yocto
Run the following commands to clone Yocto and the required layers. The `source` command sets up the environment required for building the image. If you wish to rebuilt the image later you need to re-run this `source` command in order for the `bitbake` related tools to be available and configured:
```
$ cd
$ git clone https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
$ cd poky/
$ git checkout -t origin/scarthgap -b occurity
$ git clone -b scarthgap https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
$ git clone -b scarthgap https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded
$ git clone https://code.qt.io/yocto/meta-qt6
$ git clone https://github.com/muldjord/meta-occurity
$ source oe-init-build-env
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-raspberrypi
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-python
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-qt6
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-occurity
```

### Add required Yocto configs
You should now be at the `poky/build` directory. Edit `conf/local.conf` and add the following lines to the very top of the file:
```
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED = "synaptics-killswitch commercial"
WKS_FILE = "sdimage-raspberrypi.wks"
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "wic.gz wic.bmap"
DISABLE_OVERSCAN = "1"
MACHINE ?= "raspberrypi4-64"
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " opengl"
PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-gstreamer1.0-plugins-base = " opengl"
```
NOTE!!! If you are building for a Raspberry Pi 3 change the MACHINE to `raspberrypi3-64`.

### Build the image
You are now ready to build the image. Depending on your host machine this can take a long time (several hours). Run the following commands to start the build. You should run this command from the `poky/build` directory:
```
$ bitbake core-image-sato
```
Bitbake is Yocto's build system. It pulls in all required source code and compiles and configures everything needed for an embedded Linux system running Occurity on a Raspberry Pi.

NOTE!!! During the bitbake procedure you might get warnings about `TMPDIR` references. These can be ignored.

### Flash the final image to an SDCard
If everything went well you will now have a working Occurity image that can be flashed onto an SDCard. Start by decompressing the image. You should run this command from the `poky/build` directory:
```
$ qzip -d --force tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/core-image-sato-raspberrypi4-64.rootfs.wic.gz
```
Now insert your SDCard and flash it with the decompressed image using your favorite SDCard flashing tool (`dd` or similar). Insert the card into your Raspberry Pi and boot it up. After a little while Occurity will be automatically launched. Be sure to check the rest of the documentation on how to use Occurity.

## Building Occurity on Ubuntu
NOTE!!! If you've already built the Raspberry Pi image as documented above you do not need to continue with these instructions. The following describes how to compile and run Occurity on Ubuntu for anyone who wishes to do so.

### Software prerequisites
Run the following commands in a terminal on Ubuntu to install the prerequisites needed for Occurity to function correctly.
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5multimedia5-plugins
$ sudo apt remove gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
```
The `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad` package might not be installed already. But try removing it to be sure. Having it installed is known to break h.264 video playback needed by the Occurity attention video player.

### Download and compile
Open a terminal on Ubuntu and run the following commands. Be sure to substitute `LATEST` with the version number of the latest Occurity release (eg. `1.2.0`). Check [here](https://github.com/muldjord/occurity/releases) for the latest version.
```
$ cd
$ mkdir occurity
$ cd occurity
$ wget -N https://github.com/muldjord/occurity/archive/LATEST.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf LATEST.tar.gz --strip-components 1 --overwrite
$ qmake
$ make
```

### Running Occurity
You should now have a `/home/USER/occurity/Occurity` executable ready to run. Note that the first time Occurity runs it has no `config.ini`. It will therefore try to open up the Preferences dialog. The default pin-code is `4242`.

## Optotypes
Occurity comes with an optotype that was created from the ground up to adhere to the design characteristics of the original Sloan optotype created by Louise Sloan in 1959. Landolt C and tumbling E optotypes are also available. Licenses are designated in the `optotypes` subdirectories.

## Keyboard controls
The following keyboard keys are in use when running Occurity.

### General
* `q`: Enable / disable standby
* `j`: Open Job Runner dialog (requires pin-code, documented [here](docs/CONFIGINI.md))
* `p`: Open Preferences dialog (requires pin-code, documented [here](docs/CONFIGINI.md))
* `s`: Play attention video (only on RPi4 and above)
* `d`: Pause / resume attention video (only on RPi4 and above)
* `f`: Stop attention video (only on RPi4 and above)
* `g`: Play next attention video (only on RPi4 and above)

### Optotype chart specific keyboard functions
* `up`: Change to next row with bigger size
* `down`: Change to next row with smaller size
* `left`: Move entire row to the left
* `right`: Move entire row to the right
* `PgUp`: Skip n number of rows bigger (configure n in preferences)
* `PgDn`: Skip n number of rows smaller (configure n in preferences)
* `c`: Enable / disable crowding
* `m`: Switch between single and multisymbol from the selected row. Use left / right to move between them
* `r`: Randomize symbols from selected row
* `a`: Enable / disable attention animation (if one is defined for the chart in [charts.xml](docs/CHARTSXML.md))

### SVG chart specific keyboard functions
* `left / right`: Switch between SVG layers defined in [charts.xml](docs/CHARTSXML.md)

## Overall configuration
The most important Occurity settings can be configured through the [Preferences dialog](docs/PREFERENCES.md). The dialog is opened by pressing `p` on a connected keyboard. Note that a pin-code must be entered to open Preferences. This is to avoid users inadvertently changing settings that could compromise the quality of the visual acuity results (default is `4242`).

Options that aren't available in the Preferences dialog can be changed by opening the `config.ini` file in a text editor. For a complete description of all available options go [here](docs/CONFIGINI.md).

## Charts customization
Occurity comes with a number of default charts. All charts can easily be customized through the [charts.xml](docs/CHARTSXML.md) file. Go [here](docs/CHARTSXML.md) for a complete description of the format.
